Build system TODO:

* TODO Arrange for auto-shrinking Redhat install images.
** We do not need all the packages on the iso.
** Arrange for the test framework to ask the admin node what packages it has installed.
** Modify the build framework to use that info to regen a smaller yum repo.

* Push tests into the barclamps.
** TODO Make test run mostly in dependency order 
** TODO Have all tests have a deploy and test phase.
** TODO Will need to turn the test framework into a library. 

* TODO Allow the build to output packages (tarballs for now) 
** Alongside of the iso?
** In place of?
*** Or make the iso deploy using the generated tarballs...
** Perhaps generate native packages as well?

* TODO Fix common non-Crowbar related test framework failures 
** Apache softlocks on Ubuntu in KVM
*** Sometimes seen on native hardware
*** Only fix is reboot, maybe restart deploy.
*** Not as fatal as it used to be since we transitioned to Rainbows.
** Couchdb dying on Redhat
*** Short-term just have a script watch pidof couchdb and kick it when it dies.
*** Longer term use bluepill or god.
** Couchdb needs GC'ed
*** Set up a cron job to do that.

* TODO Teach Jenkins and the build system how to update submodule references. 
** Main CI step
** Smoketest with appropriate test for each barclamp checkin.
** Only update submodule ref in main repo once smoketest passes.
*** TODO Need to write more smoketests. 

* TODO Add SHA1sums to all raw file info in crowbar.yml.
** We need protection from incomplete/corrupt downloads and the like.
